Fast Algorithm for permutation
------------------------------
This repository contains programs for generate permutation of `permutation1, permutation2,
permutation3, permutation4, permutation5`, and each one is faster than the previous.\\
Bit operations is the key point of acceleration in `permutation3, permutation4, permutation5`.
